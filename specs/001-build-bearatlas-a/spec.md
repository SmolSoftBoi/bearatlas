# Feature Specification: BearAtlas Global Travel Index

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-bearatlas-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build BearAtlas, a global index of gay-bear travel experiences (bear weeks/runs, cruises, resorts, parties). Users can filter by date range, duration, country/region/city, event type, estimated size band, price band, vibe tags (dance/relax/fetish/mixed), accessibility (wheelchair/step-free), clothing-optional, and amenities (sauna/pool). View results as Map, List, or Calendar; export personal ICS. Use a 3-step Trip Wizard (dates ‚Üí location radius ‚Üí vibe/budget) to get a shortlist. Open official links for tickets; every item shows source + last-checked timestamp. Admin can review crowd reports (corrections queue). Out of scope: ticketing, payments, user auth (for MVP). Non-goals: storing full third-party content; we keep metadata + canonical links only. Acceptance: spec includes user stories, success criteria, and a review checklist for each view (Map/List/Calendar/Wizard) plus ingestion ethics."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** gay bear traveller, **I want to** discover and filter travel experiences that match my preferences, **so that** I can plan trips to events, resorts, and destinations that align with my interests and accessibility needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm planning a trip for March 2025, **When** I search for events in Europe with "dance" vibe and "clothing-optional" amenities, **Then** I see a filtered list of relevant events with official booking links
2. **Given** I need wheelchair accessibility, **When** I filter events by "wheelchair/step-free" accessibility, **Then** I only see events that meet my accessibility requirements
3. **Given** I want to see events geographically, **When** I switch to Map view, **Then** I see event locations plotted on an interactive map with clustering for dense areas
4. **Given** I'm flexible on dates but want specific vibes, **When** I use the Trip Wizard to select "relax" vibe and "sauna/pool" amenities, **Then** I get a curated shortlist of matching destinations
5. **Given** I want to track events in my calendar, **When** I export my filtered results as ICS, **Then** I receive a calendar file with all selected events

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no events match the selected filters?
- How does the system handle events with missing or outdated information?
- What occurs when official booking links are broken or unavailable?
- How are duplicate events from different sources handled?

- **Filter**: Represents user search criteria (date range, location, event type, size band, price band, vibe tags, accessibility, clothing-optional, amenities)
- **Trip Wizard State**: Represents the 3-step wizard progression (selected dates, location radius, vibe/budget preferences)
- **Crowd Report**: Represents user-submitted corrections or updates to event information
- **Admin Review**: Represents admin approval/rejection of crowd-sourced corrections
